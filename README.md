# Image Processing

This is a repository with a few examples about image processing, using the Python library `skimage`. The file 'Introduction to Image Processing.pdf' has some personal notes about the theory behind the processes used in the Jupyer Notebooks. In case you need more information about the the functions used, check out the `skimage` documentation in the following link: https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/api.html.
